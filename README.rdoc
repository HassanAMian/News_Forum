== Story Share: A Reddit Clone

This is a News Forum application in the style of Reddit made with Ruby on Rails, which allows users to post and comment stories.

* Ruby version 2.2.0

* Rails version 4.2.0


Gems Used:
- devise 
- acts_as_votable
- simple_form

Basic functionality is now complete - I will come back to this project to make it a little more like Reddit and possibly add some tests.
